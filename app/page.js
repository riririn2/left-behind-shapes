      part1: "<p>Up above the hill, surrounded by a layer of tall dry woods, there was a white meadow. The piece of land was not particularly large, but spacious enough to spot most of the approaching creatures. One could imagine how favored it would be by flocks of herbivores when the color green descended but for now, the only figure that could be spotted was that of a petite two-legged being covered in warm fur that was not part of their body.</p><p>The figure was that of a little girl, a few dozen seasons old, her eyes had witnessed enough to discern the periodically changing hues of the forest, yet still too green to know all the creatures frequenting her turf. The girl was picking up stones, carefully selecting between pieces lying in the snow. She needed a flat stone, preferably one with a wide surface, light enough for her to carry on her own. However, finding one with such specific traits proved to be a hard errand. Frustrated, she stomped with her right foot six times before hastily sitting down on the cold velvety ground.</p><p>She was looking for material for her lesson. Her master was a tad bit too occupied today to help, therefore she was on her own. Although she dared not to venture too far from her settlement, as there were far too many dangers lurking behind the dark, dried-out barks. Her elders had told her about the vicious, pointy-eared creatures that would interfere with their hunts and rob away the prey. She had never seen one before, but she knew what the beast would look like. Growing up, she was taught about most species around her turf. Their curves. The colors of the fur. How those beasts moved. All were part of her lessons, ones that only she would receive. In comparison to her peers, of which there were not many, she was quite clever and gifted with good hands, good hands that could carve beautiful clear lines and swift curves. For those merits, she was selected by her master as an apprentice to inherit the vast knowledge of the forest, of above and under, of material and invisible, and then become the wise shaman of her tribe.</p><p>When the cold breeze calmed the young apprentice&rsquo;s temper a bit, she put her hand into the small pouch and pulled out a smooth, pointed but not too sharp blade. She decided to use the untouched snow as a substitute for the unfindable slate and started to draw. Felines. Birds. Reindeers. Bulls. A herd of horses. A little cute fox. And at last, a creature, whose appearance looked like a matured reindeer at first glance, yet not quite. Stretching from its head were enormous antlers, slim bases spread into a voluptuous mass as if a pair of wings were able to grow from a quadrupedal animal. She had never seen the animal with her own eyes, she doubted none of her fellow men had ever had. Yet, the concept associated with its existence was something very special, far more revered than other beasts. The animal was their holy spirit. The story was told that the spirit emerged when her tribe was struggling to survive in the area and led them to resourceful lands that were relatively safe. Therefore, it was the holy one, the object of their adoration. And it was the duty of the wise shaman to make sure that each member of her tribe knew of its finesse.</p><p>The girl would ask her master &ldquo;Why would you dedicate yourself to praising the gracefulness of a vague being whose appearance you had never properly perceived? We know not of its fur, whether they were silky soft or grizzled. Nor the color it wore, if it was glacial white or reddish brown.&rdquo; Her little head simply could not wrap around the idea behind that murky uncertainty. For her, to be worthy of being drawn the prerequisite is that the object could be observed and recognized. And she would feel tremendous pride if her audience could pick up what she had drawn, for that meant her eyes were sufficiently keen and her vision was successfully conveyed. Under her watching eyes, with every trace that she scrutinized, she would gradually &ldquo;own&rdquo; the object. She could tolerate the creatures that she had only heard of from the hunters, as she knew they did exist, and sooner or later she would see them for herself. She could hardly find any value in an object that no longer manifested itself in front of her and her audience&rsquo;s eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;My child&rdquo;, her master would gently speak, &ldquo;You are much sharper than your friends, but you should not let those eyes confine you, for that we do not draw to merely record, and you should not be too controlling of what you create.&rdquo; She did not appreciate the tone of her teacher&rsquo;s voice, but she coud do nothing besides occasionally being swayed along when these thoughts decided to pop up into her tiny little head.</p><p><em>Crack crack.</em> Amidst her pondering, the uninvited sounds of life pulled her back to reality. Her muscles tensed, and her right hand gripped the blade tightly. <em>Please, may it be a rabbit</em>, she prayed to the spirit she had just dismissed, <em>or a weasel, I would love to see a lovely weasel.</em> She considered turning around and running away, but then she remembered the hunter&rsquo;s words that it would be the worst thing to do when facing a predator. However, she did not know what to do next. She possessed no lance, nor did she have the skills crucial for a hunt. She felt her soul pounding underneath her skin. <em>Ba-dump ba-dump ba-dump</em>. As if it was trying to tear her ears and break free.</p><p>However, the matter of her soul held no meaning to the other lifeform, as the unknown creature proceeded to make sound. <em>Crack crack&hellip; crack crack crack&hellip; crack</em>. Periodically, but quite unstable. This instability incurred a sense of relief in her. The animal was probably not well, and that meant she might have a chance to escape. This slight hope, even though very dim, cheered her up and gave her the strength to escape the petrified state brought upon by dread. Her soul was again well-contained, no more pounding. She carefully rose, ready to flee. And she did.</p><p>One leap. Two. Three. She ran with all her might, visualizing that she would sprint like the reindeer she saw fleeing from the hunters. However, as her kin had long forsaken the steadiness brought about by having four limbs on the ground, she lacked the stability that reindeer had. Therefore, she easily tripped, her weight crushed against the crisp dried barks, the brittleness so similar to the prematurely ended triumph she briefly felt. She felt immensely down. The sounds continued to emerge, and with each new beat, she could sense her demise approaching nearer. But it never came. The unruly yet slow tempo changed into waves of clatters. It was not dramatic in the way that something was advancing faster. The sounds were short, overwhelmed with sharp snaps coming from dried barks. And then she heard a loud <em>thud</em>. It was the sound of something collapsing.</p><p>After a moment of silence, when her body was again liberated from the paralysis, she got up and turned around to see behind her. The first glimpse she had was that of bare, enormous sturdy wings, resting on the disturbed snow mantle.</p>",
      part2: "<p><em>Turned out there were no wings, </em>thought the girl. She was in awe, to the extent that the pain from her tendon temporarily vanished. She stared intensely at the creature in front of her. It was majestic. One antler alone was big enough that she would not be able to measure with both arms stretched. Had it been standing; her tiny length would barely amount to its limb. But it was lying on the ground, which effectively reduced the intimidation that would have been caused by the mere size of the beast. Immediately, she recognized the animal, as she had been meticulously and begrudgingly drawing it for quite a long time. It was the holy deer her people cherished.</p><p>However, the big deer was not in a good state. Though very large in size, one could see that the animal was malnourished, there was barely any mass that could be seen between the fur and the underneath bones. Therefore, the abnormally large antlers must have taken a tremendous toll on its withered body. Gazing at the animal, she suddenly realized why her predecessors were so obsessed with it. Such a beautiful creature, even though this one was facing near death. Its size, the strange proportion of its grandiose headpiece, and its slender body brought about an imposing impression yet magical to the beholders. She wanted to draw it, to carve an imitation of its existence onto stones, and then blabber about to anyone she would come across. For the encounter alone overwhelmed her in an enchantment strong enough that she could not contain it within herself. She had to spread it, even if the sentiment would make little sense to her listeners.</p><p>The urge for a thorough observation motivated the curious child to come close. The giant deer whimpered as she approached nearer and nearer. It probably knew that she could not possibly harm it, but that would not change its natural resistance to a foreign force. Nevertheless, it could not do anything against that. Its end was coming near, blood in its vein was running cold. As she locked eyes with the now dull amber pupils of the wretched beast, its helplessness washed over her, and she felt immensely sorry for the passing of the animal. She stretched out her arm, and gently caressed its forehead, like the chief mother would do to the children in the tribe when they were distressed. The elk was faintly startled, but it calmed down when sensing that the touch meant no harm. Then the little girl whispered a prayer taught by her master, with the intent of blessing the departing soul. Eventually, the deer became utterly silent.</p><p>After the moment of solemn, she stood up. It was time to return to her shelter and inform her teacher of the holy elk, she could imagine how delighted the shaman would be. Hopefully, the icy wind would prevent the carnivores from scavaging the corpse of the poor animal.</p><p>Before leaving, she looked at it again, careful to memorize every trace and shade. There she noticed for the first time that the deer was not alone. Behind its bottom laid another body, much more modest in size, if it had stood up it would be slightly shorter than the girl. Out of curiosity, she halted her return trip and walked past the larger deer to examine. As her hand touched the smaller animal, she felt expanding and retracting movements, though very faint, but signalized life. This new-found creature must be the offspring of the dead elk.</p><p>The girl decided she might not want to tell her master the matter after all.</p><p>Accordingly, after returning to her recess, she never mentioned the encounter. She pretended to be very surprised when the hunters made an excited announcement about the discovery of a certain carcass. Her mundane life carried on, cycling between eating and sleeping, taking lessons and expenditures to gather food.</p><p>The only difference would be her occasionally asking her teacher for permission to go into the woods.</p><p>For instance, one day after finishing her lessons, she eagerly asked her mentor:</p><p>&ldquo;Master! Our source of red clay has run low. Please allow me to go find some. I happened to see a big rock with a burnt hue during the last gathering.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You sound quite urgent. There is little use for red tint in our next ritual. If you want to hone your skills, charcoal, we still have plenty, you should use just that.&rdquo; Said the mentor, with a faint skepticism.</p><p>Her pupil had been doing something out there. Permissions were requested a bit too frequently these days that it would be hard for the approver to pay no attention.</p><p>&ldquo;Master, red shade is too scarce, therefore I&rsquo;m afraid I have not been practicing with it enough.&rdquo; The young acolyte explained. She was adamant about going out today. &ldquo;And decorating the remains of the holy deer would require a lot of ochre. We will have to collect less if we already have some today.&rdquo;</p><p>The older woman stared at the girl for a few seconds, as if she was trying to pierce through her fa&ccedil;ade with her gaze. Nevertheless, after a sigh, the child still got what she desired.</p><p>&ldquo;May the spirits lead you well.&rdquo;</p><p>In the end, the woman indulged her kid. She knew that the mischievous girl would sneak out had she forbidden her, which would not be very desirable. With the granted blessing, the little girl jumped joyfully. She told her mentor goodbye before hurrying herself on her way out of the settlement.</p><p>The girl had been in an elated state quite consistently these days. She had found a new source of joy. The only hassle was that this newfound delight was situated outside of her home cave, thus she would need to ask for permission every time she went, and with that, to come up with a plausible excuse. But she was willing to compromise.</p><p>The young girl walked the trail leading to a narrow woodland near her shelter, following the mountain&rsquo;s edge closely. She did not dare to haste, for the ice-fused soil could be quite punishing for impatient travelers. She made a detour nearby, looking around for signs of thickets. Luckily, she managed to find dark green spots amidst the dormant forest. Brushing away the snow layer on the plants, she found a handful of resilient berries and sedges. Satisfied with her precious loot, the girl returned to her previous track. She did not want to stray too deep into the woods, as that would be quite dangerous. She trod forward, leaving behind trails of footsteps and muffled sounds of crushed icy bits. After a few turns, stood before her was a slope leading to the higher terrain, slightly hidden from absent-minded eyes by the thick bushes. Finding stable grips for her footing, she steadily advanced. After a few slides downward and upward turns, she finally reached her destination, a narrow entrance to a rock shelter.</p><p>The inside of the cave was a bit lower than the level of the entrance, hindering the sunlight from filling the inner space. Still, one could vaguely spot a slender silhouette resting at the bottom of the shallow pit. The figure raised its slim neck, it seemed to have noticed the arrival of an additional party. &ldquo;Moo-wee! Moo-wee!&rdquo; It called out, contained in the timid voice was a slight hint of joy, showing its fondness for the entering guest. Smiling happily as she sensed the coming affection, the bipedal visitor jumped down from the terrain and rushed to the side of the creature.</p><p>&ldquo;Kept you waiting, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; She asked apologetically, though without any expectation of reciprocation. She quickly untied her sack. Inside it was grass and fruits, half was her share of food she had saved, and the other half was the haul from earlier. Her opposite screeched joyfully as she laid the fare in front of it. It leaned forward, opened its mouth, and started to chew the freshly picked leaves. The girl watched over gently. While the young elk before her hardly gained any mass ever since their encounter, its disposition had become much livelier. Despite being very few, the nutrients she gathered for the calf had proved to be quite helpful, both in keeping the animal alive and forming the interspecific bond between the two individuals.</p><p>The calf continued eating as the girl observed it meticulously. After a while, she decided to start making a small fireplace. When finished with that, she pulled out the tools she had in her bag: several blades, charcoals, hollow bone tubes, and pouches of pigments. She then crawled to the end of the cave to pick up a stone piece lying on the ground. It was a particular stone. The surface was quite flat and slightly curved inward in the middle. The apprentice poured a thick liquid into the concave part, lit it up, and placed the stone lamp near her.</p><p>With everything set in place, she finally started her practice. Under the dim light, the stone wall revealed itself full of tantalized engravings, implying the scarcity of space. The girl paused a bit to choose the draft she wanted to work on. Once decided, she grabbed a piece of charcoal and outlined the etched curves. Occasionally, she would quickly glance at the still-eating animal and then proceed with her drawing. As her hand moved, a figure gradually emerged on the rock surface. An eye. Four slender legs. A curvy tummy. Flowy mane along the neck. At each stray line, the girl felt a tad upset, but she was able to complete the drawing nonetheless. With the outline finished, she turned swiftly to pick up the hollow tube, filled one with the brown pigment mixed with the thick liquid she used for the lamp, its brim vertically aligned with one other tube she held one end close to her lip. Then she started to blow vigorously. Colors bloomed onto the wall along with her breath, crafting a beautiful brown shade. However, before she could fill out the outline, the light flickered and went out, shrouding the stone wall again in the veil of darkness. She was not quick enough. Slightly frustrated, she let out a sigh.</p><p>Being intensely focused on a short burst of time could take a toll on the practitioner. Deeming herself to have been adequately diligent, she inched to the side of her four-legged friend for a little comfort. The young elk had finished feeding itself, large brown eyes watched in curiosity as she slowly approached. Having had its stomach partially filled up, it could indulge her bit of reassurance. It stood up, ambled toward her, and then leaned in to lick her right cheek gently.</p><p>It had been several cycles of moon and sun since the young apprentice met the holy deer. Because of the blooming urge in her on the spur of the moment, she mustered her strength and took the still-breathing offspring of the deceased beast to her secret hideout. It was quite an effort, yet still manageable, as the animal was absurdly light for its size. Ever since, she had been tending the calf, as often as she could. She gave it her food share, foraged the woods on its behalf, and harvested clean snow to provide it with water. In the beginning, she worried that it would wander away, so she, reluctant at first, shrouded a torn-down piece of her attire with its parent&rsquo;s scent, then hid the cloth in the cave, with the hope that the lingering presence of the big deer would soothe its grief and give it a reason stay where it was. And somehow that seemed to work. The young calf never left the shelter. Or perhaps it was simply incapable of leaving the cave, as malnourished as it was.</p><p>Regardless, she had her goal achieved and found herself a new friend, whose company she appreciated. The girl never really had friends. There were not many youngsters in her tribe after all, and adding up to that was her preference for solitude. The young elk was the perfect partner for her. It did not, or could not talk much.</p><p>Gradually, the visits became an essential part of her routine. Every other turn of daylight she would come to the rock shelter, supplying the hungry calf with food, and then hone her skills with the young deer staying in an observable vicinity. And as if to return the favor for the food supply, it would attempt to comfort her at any indication of her feeling dejected. The cavern wall was crammed with sketches and shapes similar to its only tenant. Ranging from shaky curves and smudged color spots to firm and perfect line art. From the frequency, one could see the affection of the artist for her model. She could not resist preserving every trace and grace of her adorable companion. Her favorite part would be the creature&rsquo;s eyes. Big brown eyes seemed capable of granting her an endless stream of tenderness.</p>",
      part3: "<p>Her simple happiness stretched on as the moon and the sun continued taking turns to nudge the forest bit by bit nearer to its wake.</p><p>The young girl realized that her friend matured at a much different pace than her. When standing up on all fours, the calf would be taller than her by several stretches of palm. And it turned irritated quite often. The pain from its growing antlers bursting out underneath the skin might contribute partly to that, she assumed. One day it would swing its head forcefully, stomping on the bedrock as if it wanted to shatter the ground beneath. Another day it would curl up and seemingly weep. The immature apprentice did not know what to do. Or maybe she was trying to advert her thoughts from a certain obvious conclusion. And that was not the only problem that emerged.</p><p>The ceiling of the entrance to their rock shelter was not high enough for an adult from her tribe to pass without crawling.</p><p>As she recalled the size of the adult elk, she just could not ignore the murky feeling stirring inside her stomach, a mixture of worry and guilt.</p><p>Helpless, she turned to her teacher, begging for help.</p><p>At the sudden revelation, the older shaman was baffled. &ldquo;We shall stop taking if our stomachs are full.&rdquo; Such was the golden rule of the tribe. They believed the reciprocation from the forest would cease if they did otherwise. Therefore, captivating a creature of another species was not a concept that she could apprehend, let alone for the animal to be related to the deity of their tribe. The action of her pupil made her worried, that such blasphemy would bring about misfortune to their tribe. Flustered, the mentor scolded sternly.</p><p>&ldquo;Master, I am aware of my wrongdoing,&rdquo; said the acolyte sheepishly, &ldquo;I will take any punishment.&rdquo;</p><p>The humbled tone in the youthful voice watered the shaman&rsquo;s anger cold. After letting out a sigh, she simply asked the girl her reasoning.</p><p>The girl confessed:</p><p>&ldquo;At first, I only intended to have it near until I could master drawing its shapes. But then, I couldn&rsquo;t help being attached. I didn&rsquo;t know that having a company would be so delightful, master.&rdquo;</p><p>At the reveal of rare vulnerability, the older woman sighed. She regretted raising her descendant isolated from other children. Perhaps without the loneliness, the child would not have wound up making the decision. Maybe she would not have had this fateful encounter at all. With the surging guilt, the mentor could not bring herself to refuse the request of her pupil.</p><p>The next day, they went to the hidden cave together. As usual, the young calf would raise its head looking forward to the food. However, it quickly turned wary at the presence of an unknown scent.</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my friend. Just like me, she will do you no harm.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl tried to comfort it as her mentor was bewildered. She was thrilled to witness a living specimen, an unripe one even, of the very idol she had been dedicating her life to praise. Her eyes stared at the calf with care, but then the same keen observation quickly brought her back to the present state.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It needs to be freed from this place.&rdquo;</p><p>She announced the answer that her younger counterpart had been unwilling to accept.</p><p>&ldquo;But&hellip; Would there be any other way, master?&rdquo; The young girl's voice sounded slightly desperate, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it shall never return.&rdquo;</p><p>She had thought her benevolent master could come up with a solution, something her little head could not think of. She was the great wise shaman after all.</p><p>&ldquo;My child, I believe you are well aware of the reason why.&rdquo;</p><p>The girl did not reply. It was clear to her that this narrow shelter would barely be sufficient for the growth of a beast of that size. She was averting her eyes from the conceivable fact. Words from her teacher were the clear gush to wash away that intended ignorance.</p><p>As the pair came to a silent agreement, they started to help the animal climb out of the cave. With the support of an older woman from below, guiding the inexperienced elk toward the low entrance was no longer unrealizable. A light push was all needed to relieve the occasional reluctance from the under-fed calf. Eventually, they managed to get out.</p><p>Fully exposed to the sunlight, the elk shuddered. Brown eyes blinked continuously in an attempt to adapt. Nevertheless, it was curious, in a very delighted temper. It trotted toward the edge of the rocky bed and leaned its long neck to peak beneath, only to quickly jerk back frightened because of a slight slide. The calf followed its human guides, very excited despite its incapability to move forward whenever they came across a steep ridge. Its new-found excitement was at the cost of its human friend&rsquo;s relief, as she was overcome with worries. She knew that the sheltered animal would have a hard time on its own. How could the gentle beast survive when it could barely maneuver itself?</p><p>At that moment, a thought sparkled within her. If the young elk became her peer, then it could live on, together with her. What a lovely idea.</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is our holy spirit,&rdquo; she tried to elaborate a sound reason to convince her teacher, &ldquo;It should stay with us. Everyone would be happy if they could pray to a presenting deity.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, my child!&rdquo; The older woman exclaimed. Her pupils expanded into anger, &ldquo;Halt yourself from those blooming wicked ideas in that head of yours!&rdquo;</p><p>She was bewildered because such an idea went against the rule of the tribe.</p><p>But the young girl could not apprehend the drama from her teacher&rsquo;s perspective, nor the strict following of the tribe&rsquo;s principal. She simply wanted to keep the elk near her. And she believed she could convince her fellow tribesmen had the shaman agreed.</p><p>Then her teacher asked:</p><p>&ldquo;My child, I shall need to educate you later. But those aside, have you ever thought about the wish of the elk?&rdquo;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;It likes me quite a lot, master. I believe if it could talk, our wishes would align!&rdquo;</p><p>Despite the raised voice, the girl&rsquo;s face lacked the usual confidence of being a prodigy. She tried to come up with a retort, but words were held back in her throat by rationality. Her eyes moved slightly to her animal friend, only to have the skin and bone state of the beast telling her that her master had hit the right spot.</p><p>The tension remained. The silent protest of the younger girl crystalized the air into a thin brittle sheet between them, preventing the older woman from producing an immediate response. She did not want to reply thoughtlessly because as a mentor she could not use aggression as a means to teach. She wanted to properly educate her descendants. Therefore, the silence was prolonged.</p><p>A series of rapid, tearing sounds were the ones to break the thin barrier between them.</p><p>As she was abruptly taken back to reality, the acolyte saw lines extending from her master&rsquo;s backside. Burst with a surge of survival instinct, the calf ran hastily from where they stood after a screech. Somewhere in between, she heard the older woman shout at her, &ldquo;Run!&rdquo; And she did, mindlessly. The last image she saw was the shaman falling forward. Straight lines that hurt her teacher so badly desperately tried to connect with the contour of the fleeing beast.</p>"
